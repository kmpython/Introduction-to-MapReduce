This project contains the assignment source codes for "Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce" course by Udacity.

This was a hands on course on two data sets - a sales data and server log data. We had to write various map reduce codes to answer specific questions. The excerises were based on various MapReduce design patterns like filtering, summerization, top-N, combiners etc.
The data description is included in the project sub-folders and the problem statements are included in the MapReduce code itself so that we can relate the process to the questions we are trying to answer.

For this course, we have used a Non-Commercial Cloudera Cluster over a VM provided by Udacity & Cloudera. We have used hadoop streaming and Python as the choice of our language to complete the exercises.
